# vivarium — verified bibliography (relata-backed)

*(Built 2026-07-03; PDF column updated 2026-07-09. Every entry below was verified
against its publisher or archive page (title/authors/venue/year/DOI) and lives in
relata with a `bib-fields` verification event by
`claude-fable-5-vivarium-bibliography`. Use `relata show <key>` for full metadata;
PDFs are registered in relata's external store where we could legitimately obtain
them. Only publisher-OA, arXiv, HAL/institutional repositories, and authors' own
pages were used.)*

## The manual-chase list (verified real; we could not download legitimately by script)

Most of these are one browser-click for a human — the blockers are bot-walls,
not paywalls, for at least the HAL and AGU items.

**Obtained 2026-07-09** (7 — author/HAL/eprints copies, registered in relata,
git-ignored local copies per the note at top): `berger-1984-adaptive`,
`gear-1984-multirate`, `almeida-2012-improving`, `almeida-2013-applicability`,
`cordonnier-2016-large`, `galin-2019-review`, `schott-2023-large`.

## Corrections found during verification

- **`water.rs:350` misattributes the θ-scheme.** The comment says "θ flux
  smoothing (de Almeida & Bates 2013)"; the θ-weighted flux scheme is
  **de Almeida, Bates, Freer & Souvignet 2012** (WRR 48, W05528,
  `almeida-2012-improving`). The 2013 paper (`almeida-2013-applicability`)
  is the *applicability* study. One-line comment fix, deliberately not
  applied here (crates/ was under concurrent integration work at the time).
- **"Schott 2023" disambiguated**: it is *Large-scale terrain authoring
  through interactive erosion simulation*, ToG 42(5), DOI 10.1145/3592787.
  The adjacent 10.1145/3618350 is the same group's meandering-rivers paper —
  a nice future source for the bank-mechanics rung, but a different paper.
- **All attributions in `multiscale-methods.md` checked out** (Berger &
  Oliger 1984; Brandt 1977; E & Engquist 2003; Kevrekidis et al. 2003; Gear
  & Wells 1984; Grabowski 2001 / Khairoutdinov & Randall 2001) — its
  "unverified training memory" caveat is now discharged and the doc updated
  with exact years.
- Two title typos exist *on Project Euclid's own pages* ("Heterognous",
  "Mocroscopic") — trust the DOIs, not their HTML titles, if scraping.

## Not ingested, deliberately

Web resources cited in `ref/geology/NOTES.md` that are not papers (Azgaar's
Fantasy Map Generator notes, Experilous planet-generation blog, Gumin's
WaveFunctionCollapse repo, Summerville/Aokana posts): real influences, wrong
shape for a citation manager — they stay as URLs in the NOTES that use them.
Deeper rungs we haven't built yet (bank-mechanics/meandering sources, glacial
and aeolian process papers, Whittaker's biome classification) belong to a
second sweep when those systems are actually being designed.
